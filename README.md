# 🚀 KitchenAI Bento Demo  

Welcome to the **KitchenAI Bento Box Demo!** 🍱  
This guide will help you set up and interact with a **KitchenAI Bento Box** through the **KitchenAI Playground**. By the end, you’ll be able to:  

✅ Run example use cases  
✅ Generate responses using your own KitchenAI app in the Playground  

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  

1️⃣ **Create a Virtual Environment**  

In your terminal, run:  

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then activate it:  
- **Mac/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`  
- **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`  

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Choose a Use Case  

Go to the **`examples`** folder in the KitchenAI repository.  
- Pick a **use case notebook** that interests you.  
- Open it in **Jupyter Notebook**.  
- Run all the cells in the notebook.  

---

## 🌐 Step 2: Set Up in KitchenAI Playground  

1️⃣ Visit [KitchenAI Playground](https://playground.kitchenai.dev/apps/playground/).  
2️⃣ **Generate a Client ID:** This ID uniquely identifies your app.  
3️⃣ Copy the generated `client_id`.  

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Run Your KitchenAI Client  

After running the use case notebook, set up your client by running the following code:  

```python
client = WhiskClient(
    nats_url="nats://nats.playground.kitchenai.dev:4222",
    client_id="your-client-id-here",  # Replace with your generated client ID
    user="playground",
    password="kitchenai_playground",
    kitchen=kitchen,
)

await client.run()
```

- This **connects your app to the KitchenAI Playground**.  
- Once `client.run()` executes, your app is **ready to respond** to requests in the Playground UI.  

---

## 🔥 Step 4: Test Your App  

1️⃣ Open the [KitchenAI Playground](https://playground.kitchenai.dev/apps/playground/).  
2️⃣ Select your **app name** and **send a request**.  
3️⃣ View the response and experiment with different prompts.
