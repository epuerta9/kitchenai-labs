This could involve hiring more staff or reallocating existing personnel from other departments.\n   - **Budget Adjustment:** An increase in responsibilities would require a reassessment and likely expansion of the marketing budget to accommodate new initiatives, campaigns, and tools needed to support additional tasks.\n\n2. **Increased Collaboration:**\n   - **Partnership with Additional Agencies:** Given the expanded scope, there might be an increase in collaboration with other specialized agencies or consultants to provide expertise in new areas. This could include additional public relations, digital development, or creative partners beyond those already engaged.\n\n3. **Strategic Evolution:**\n   - **Broader Target Segments:** The team might expand its focus to include new market segments or geographic regions. This would necessitate revised marketing strategies and the development of new campaigns catered to these audiences.\n   - **Enhanced Market Research:** To effectively address the doubled scope, there would be a greater emphasis on gathering and analyzing market intelligence. Utilizing insights from partners like SMARI and Destination Analysts would become even more critical to ensure data-driven decision making.\n\n4. **Technological Investments:**\n   - **Advanced Tools and Platforms:** Implementation of more sophisticated analytics, project management, and communication tools would be necessary to streamline operations, optimize campaigns, and improve tracking of KPIs.\n\n5. **Refined Reporting and Accountability:**\n   - **Comprehensive Reporting Systems:** With an expanded role, the need for more detailed reporting and analytics would arise, requiring a reevaluation of current systems to ensure they can handle the increased data and deliver meaningful insights.\n   - **Clearer Performance Metrics:** Establishing new, detailed outcome indicators would help track progress against a broader set of goals, ensuring accountability across all projects.\n\nUltimately, for the Marketing Communications team to thrive under an expanded scope, it would require a concerted effort to enhance resources, refine strategies, and harness technology to manage increased expectations effectively.",
