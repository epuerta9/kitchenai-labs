# MCCVB “ABOUT US”

MCCVB is the Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) for the County of Monterey, made up of nine jurisdictions and a vibrant local industry that includes hundreds of hotels and resorts, major attractions, renowned wineries and restaurants, and a variety of additional businesses that fuel the tourism economy. The Monterey County region includes the Monterey Peninsula, Big Sur, North County, South County and the Salinas Valley.

MCCVB oversees the production of a variety of marketing activities that may include television and online advertising, content marketing to include website, social media, content series, collateral and maps, cooperative programs and public relations programs – all designed to promote Monterey County to consumers, meeting/group planners, media, and the travel trade industry.

The current MCCVB business plan can be viewed here.

# Brand Positioning + Personality

Monterey County is located on the stunning central coast in California. The Monterey County destination brand is based on the idea of “invigorating the soul.” The experience is so inspiring and life enriching that our taglines encourage making the most of every moment: “Grab Life by the Moments” and for group travel, “Inspired Moments in Meetings.” Note: we are not looking to re-brand at this time, however we are looking for an agency partner to start working with now that can lead us through a rebrand in the next few years as part of a larger organizational transformation.

We used consumer research to derive the destination brand as “Monterey,” (consumers recognize the geographic area as “Monterey” + find the name to be highly inspirational) an umbrella identity. The brand marketing program involves and promotes the Monterey County product from Seaside to Soledad, Moss Landing to Big Sur, Carmel-by-the-Sea to Pebble Beach and each and every life-enriching moment within. A key challenge is ensuring travelers connect this array of amazing places with the brand name “Monterey”.

# MEASURING SUCCESS

The #1 goal for MCCVB is increasing overnight visits. The marketing communications team’s overarching goal is to increase intent to visit, as measured by our research partner SMARI. In addition to this goal, the team has a set of strategic and tactical metrics to measure success, which are tracked monthly.

1. Web Visits: increasing website visits has been and will remain a key metric. While overall focus is to increase numbers (quantitative), qualitative considerations are also important. The goal is to increase the overall number of unique visits and ensure the right traffic.
2. Partner Handoffs: while attracting traffic to the MCCVB site is important, just as important is moving users down the funnel and sending them directly to stakeholder and business sites to book, reserve, buy, etc. This metric allows MCCVB to show value by bringing customers directly to stakeholders’ digital door.
3. Website RFP Submissions: a key metric for group business, meetings, and conferences in support of the Business Development team, showing group marketing efforts are driving qualified and interested users to the site.
4. Social Engagement: MCCVB considers a like, share, comment or video play on any of MCCVB’s social platforms an engagement. With engagement rates typically above industry average, this is a valuable metric showing success in both paid and owned efforts.

Additional metrics may be added to show success in different and specific ways. The agency should be prepared to work with MCCVB to find ways to effectively communicate metrics and results to the board and stakeholders.

# BUDGET & TERM

Proposed monthly agency fees should include work as identified in the scope above – with the exception of media and production hard costs – in the range of $18,000- $20,000 per month.

# PROPOSAL STRUCTURE AND REQUIREMENTS

1. Company background and how your agency differentiates itself
2. Company leadership and day-to-day account staff
3. Initial ideas that demonstrate how your agency’s experience and capabilities can address the following areas of opportunity:
- Responsible Travel: The notion of “over tourism” continues to be of concerns for many destinations, especially as the world comes out of the pandemic. Discuss how your agency would integrate responsible and sustainable travel messaging into a marketing plan, and how it would support MCCVB’s mission to grow Monterey County tourism while balancing quality of life for our residents and natural environment.
- Meetings and events: Monterey County is an inspiring destination for meetings, conferences and incentive travel. The return of the group business segment will play a very important role in Monterey County’s tourism and economic recovery.

While the execution of MCCVB’s owned programming is done in-house, how would your agency help take our website, blog and social content strategy to the next level and integrate paid and owned media programs? How can you work with our PR agency to include earned media in the mix as well?

# Solidifying the brand

Monterey County is a world-class destination. How would your agency help to communicate and solidify the Monterey County brand as a premier travel destination?
