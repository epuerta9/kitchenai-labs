    "# Structured Planning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A key pattern in agents is the ability to plan. ReAct for example, uses a structured approach to decompose an input into a set of function calls and thoughts, in order to reason about a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, breaking down the initial input/task into several sub-tasks can make the ReAct loop (or other reasoning loops) easier to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StructuredPlanningAgnet` in LlamaIndex wraps any agent worker (ReAct, Function Calling, Chain-of-Abstraction, etc.) and decomposes an initial input into several sub-tasks. Each sub-task is represented by an input, expected outcome, and any dependendant sub-tasks that should be completed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through both the high-level and low-level usage of this agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This agent leverages both structured outputs and agentic reasoning. Because of this, we would recommend a capable LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), and open-source LLMs may struggle to plan without prompt engineering or fine-tuning."

Interest rate risk is associated with the company's refinanced term loan facilities, which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates that could impact financial statements. Investment risk involves the preservation of capital and meeting liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk, with investments primarily in money market funds and cash deposits. Foreign currency risk arises from international transactions in multiple currencies, which could affect revenue and operating results due to exchange rate fluctuations.\n",

      "2. **Cybersecurity Risk**: The company faces risks from cyberattacks, including malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing, which could harm its reputation, business, and operating results. These attacks could disrupt the security of the company's systems and platforms, compromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of intellectual property, and necessitate increased resources to enhance technological defenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Compliance and Relationship Risk with Payment Networks**: Failure to maintain compliance with payment card network standards or to maintain good relationships with these networks could lead to increased costs, loss of credit card acceptance privileges, or adverse modifications to the terms under which these privileges are granted. This could negatively impact the company's business, revenue, and operating results.\n",
